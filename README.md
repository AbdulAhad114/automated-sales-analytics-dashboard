## Project Overview

This project delivers a fully automated, dynamic Excel dashboard designed to provide business users with deep insights into their sales data. By integrating data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization, the dashboard empowers users to make informed, data-driven decisions without needing technical expertise.

## Business Challenges Addressed

Organizations often find it difficult to answer:

- Which products generate the highest revenue and profit, and what are their associated costs?

- What trends exist in financial metrics such as revenue, costs, and profit over time?

- How do order statuses (completed, pending, returned) evolve, and what operational patterns emerge?

- How are orders distributed by payment method and geography?

- Automating data integration and cleaning from multiple datasets.

- Presenting interactive visualizations including geographical revenue distribution, revenue/cost/profit by product category, and daily/monthly revenue trends.

- Offering real-time updates with minimal manual intervention once set up.
