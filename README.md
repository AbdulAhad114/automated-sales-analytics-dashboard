# Sales Analytics Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project delivers a fully automated, dynamic Excel dashboard designed to transform raw sales and cost data into insightful, actionable business intelligence. It enables business users to explore key metrics such as revenue, costs, profits, order statuses, and payment methods without needing advanced technical skills.

## Dataset Structure
The dashboard utilizes the "sales_data" dataset:

- Sheet1 (Sales Orders): Contains transactional sales data with columns like Order ID, Customer Name, Product Category, Product Name, Order Date, Delivered Date, Quantity, Unit Price, Status, Country, and Payment Method.

- Sheet2 (Product Costs): Lists each Product Name alongside its Cost Percentage to calculate total costs and profit margins accurately.

## Business Challenges Addressed

Organizations often find it difficult to answer:

- Identifying which products generate the highest revenue and profit, including their associated costs.

- Tracking trends in financial metrics such as revenue, cost, and profit over time.

- Understanding how order statuses (completed, pending, returned) evolve and identifying operational patterns.

- Analyzing orders by payment method and geographical distribution.
## Solution
This Excel dashboard provides an end-to-end solution by:

- Automating data integration and cleaning from dataset.

- Visualizing sales revenue by country, revenue, cost, and profit by category.

- Displaying monthly revenue trends and order statuses interactively.

- Breaking down orders by payment methods with easy-to-use slicers.

- Requiring no manual intervention after initial setup, suitable for business users.
